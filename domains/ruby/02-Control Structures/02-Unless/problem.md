You've updated the score of every HackerRank user who participated in a contest. Sometimes, HackerRank admins also participate in a given contest but care is taken to ensure that their submissions do not get any score and their score is not updated.

Like the previous challenge, you are given a method `scoring` with an array passed as an argument. Each element of the array is of class `User`.

`User` has two public methods, `is_admin?` and `update_score`. Your task in this challenge is to use the control structure `unless` and update all elements of the array who are not `admins`.

**Hint**

```
unless user.is_admin?
    user.update_score
end

```

or

```
user.update_score unless user.is_admin? 

```

The above code is a Ruby one liner.

**Explanation**

`unless` is the logical equivalent of `if not`
