This is a wonderful exercise which explains the concept of infinite loops.

"A coder practices on HackerRank until he reaches the rating O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

An infinite loop in Ruby is of the form

```
loop do
end

```

Use an infinite loop and call the method `coder.practice` within it and break if `coder.oh_one?` is true.

`break if` conditions in Ruby are of the form

```
if <condition>
    break
end

```

or a one-liner

```
break if <condition>  

```
