This challenge has a beautiful one-liner answer.

"A coder practices on HackerRank until he reaches the rating O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

Call the method `coder.practice` until `coder.oh_one?` becomes `true`.

Use the `until` control structure.

`until` is the logical equivalent of `while not`.

**Hint**

```
while not <condition>
    <code>
end

```

or

```
until <condition>
    <code>
end

```

or the beautiful one-liner

```
<code> until <condition>  

```
