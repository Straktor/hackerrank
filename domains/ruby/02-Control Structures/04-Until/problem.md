This challenge has a beautiful one-liner answer.

"A coder practices on HackerRank until he reaches the rating O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

Call the method coder.practice until coder.oh_one? becomes true.

Use the until control structure.

until is the logical equivalent of while not.

## Hint

```ruby
while not <condition>
    <code>
end
```

or

```ruby
until <condition>
    <code>
end
```

or the beautiful one-liner

```ruby
<code> until <condition>
```
