Each object in Ruby may have methods associated with it. To demonstrate this, we want you to print whether a number is even or odd. A `number` has an `even?` method associated with it, which returns `true` or `false` based on the parity of the number.

Assuming a variable `number` is already defined, check whether a given `number` is even or not.

**Hint**

Type in the code-editor

```
return number.even?

```

or

```
number.even?

```
