One of the most commonly used data structures in Ruby is a Ruby Array, and below we see various methods of initializing a ruby array.

Your task is to initialize three different variables as explained below.

*   Initialize an empty array with the variable name `array`

**Hint**

```
array = Array.new

```

or

```
array = []

```

*   Initialize an array with exactly one `nil` element in it with the variable name `array1`

**Hint**

```
array1 = Array.new(1)

```

or

```
array1 = [nil]

```

*   Initialize an array with exactly two elements with value `10` in it using the variable name `array2`.

**Hint**

```
array2 = Array.new(2, 10)

```

or

```
array2 = [10, 10]

```
